20 questions. Each question worth 1 point

Midterm focuses on software engineering

### Waterfall
Its is not very successful 
Computing time very expensive 
People were cheap but computer time expensive

Doesn't work today 
- Cannot get all requirements from customer at front
- Lengthy deliver 
- No concept of customer response
### Agile
- Agile is a mindset and we use scrum
Scrum software development lifecycle
- allows us to bust out working software every 2 weeks (sprint)
- Scrum has 
	- self organizing teams
	- 1-2 week sprints
	- product backlog *(requirements)*
	- One of the agile processes 
Meetings
- Daily scrum
- sprint review
- Sprint retrospective
- Release planning
Scums has
- Product backlog
- Sprint backlog
- Potentially shippable product

Scrum roles
- Product owner - person who defines project
- Scrum master - manages scrum team that enables the management in the project
	- They remove impediments. Allows the team to work as well as -possible
- Team - cross functional, self organizing, membership should only change after a sprint

Product backlog
- List of all desired work on the product
- Prioritize each and every sprint comes from the product owner
- Reprioritized at the start of each sprint

Managing the backlog
- Individuals sign up for work
- Estimate how long
- Update how much work done

The sprint
- 2 - 4 weeks
- Product is designed coded and tested during a sprint
- constant iteration
- Each sprint is a prokject
- each sprint builds incrementally of the sprint that came before it
	1. Plan the work
	2. the work
	3. scrum
	4. review

### KANBAN
- Visual board
- Toyota uses it
- practice visualizing the workflow
- flows left to right
- limit your WIP 
- Whole goal is you don't overload yourself
- manage the flow
- Optimize the flow by monitoring flow metrics
- make policies clear and explicit
- everyone must understand how the work is flowing

The product backlog
- Epics
- Smaller sized stories
- Defects (bugs)
Agile meetings
- 5 meetings
1. Backlog
2. planning
3. scrum
4. sprint
5. retrospective

Daily scrum
- ask 3 questions
- what'd u do yesterday
- what will u do today
- blockers?
- 15 mins or less

Sprint review
- team presents to the product owner
- just show them their new product
- 2 hour prep time rule (no more than that)

Retrospective meeting
- What did we do well
- what did not
- what needs to change to do better

User stories
- As a who I want a what because why

Scaling through a scrum of scrums
- Lean software development
- Goal is the want to eliminate waste.
- Everything not out to the customer is waste

SAFE 
- Scaled file framework
- multiple agile teams to work on complex project 

Why safe?
-  All about doing agile in a business with a bunch of agile teams
- ART (Agile release train)
	- Basically a bunch of teams
	- Program increment (PI)
PI 
- Timebox in which an ART delivers work
- 8-12 weeks long
- 4 iterations (normal sprints)
- Followed by 1 with downtime where you fix some stuff


Difference between programming and coding
- Coding is the use of using a computer to write code
- Programming is bigger, you think about the bigger picture. In a way it is a superset of coding
	- Makes every part of coding programming
What is software engineering
- Encompasses not the act of writing code but using all of the tools and processes an organization uses to build a product 
- **Programming integrated over time. Not just a bunch of one off projects.** 
- There are 3 principles
	1. Time and change
	2. Scale and growth
	3. Tradeoffs and cost
Software engineering scope

Software engineering process
1. Requirements
	- What your application must provide
	- used to point your program in the right direction
	- Business requirements
		- BRD (business requirement document)
			- Talks about what a business really needs
			- Describes what needs to happen in this project
			- Should not have technical jargon but instead the common understanding across stake holders
		- FRD (Functional requirement document)
			- Functional requirements
			- What a system should do
			- Each function has input output and processing logic
			- Address the behavior of the system
		- SRS (software requirement specification )
			- What OS
			- What speed, what's the cost, etc.
		- How can we deal with change?
			- Take steps now to mitigate it when it shows up
			- Apply careful requirement tracing
			- Spans the entire software lifecycle 
2. Software design
	- Provides 3 things
		1. Develops top structure level and organization
		2. Details
		3. Specifies components so someone can actually code it up
	- Key issues
		- 2 step process
			1. Architectural design
			2. Detailed design
		The output of these 2 record major decision that is taken
	- Software design defines what software is and what it can be
	- Design pattern
		- Design pattern solution to programming problems
3. Construction
	- Refers to the detailed creation of working software, coding, testing, debugging etc.
		- Unit test and integration tests are used to check work
		- During construction is when testing mostly happens
	- You want to minimize complexity to make this step easier
		- Just use simple code and logic rather than fancy complex logic
	- Reusing assets can improve cost and productivity when developing
		- Construction for reuse: making something that someone else will reuse (maybe you)
		- Constriction with reuse: Building something reusing other existing assets.
		- 4 key OOP Concepts
		1. Abstraction
		2. Encapsulation
		3. Inheritence
		4. Polymorphism
	- Test first programming
		- Writing test cases before you program so when you first start everything fails.
