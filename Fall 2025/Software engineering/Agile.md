### Waterfall method
5 parts of waterfall method for creating software
1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Development
4. Testing
5. Deployment
Potential issues with this method
- You can never specify all the project requirements prior to the creation process (ppl can also change their mind)
- Times change
- Lengthy delivery cycle
- Inability to use new technologies
- changes take just as long as original project
- no concept of customer "voice"
---
### Agile is different from waterfall
- Allows for active customer change requests during the development cycle
Test driven development
- start with tests so they will initially all fail. Eventually, when all of the test passes, the program works
### Scrum (Note scrum is a framework)
- agile process that allows us to focus on delivering the highest business value in the shortest amount of time
- allows us to rapidly and repeatedly inspect actual working software
- the business sets the priorities. Teams self organize to determine the best way to deliver the highest priority features.
- Every two weeks to a month anyone can see real working software and decide to release it as is or continue to enhance it for another sprint

### 9 rules of scrum 
1. There are 3 roles in scrum:
	- Product owner - person who owns the product backlog and prioritize work
	- scrum master - coaches team
	- development team - team
2. The product backlog is prioritized by the product owner. items are ordered by value, risk, priority, and dependencies
3. Work in code in a consistent time frame of a sprint (usually 2 weeks)
4. Sprint begins with sprint planning (meeting) and decides what to work on during that current sprint. Usually stored on the backlog
5. The team commits to delivering a potentially shippable product by the end of the sprint
6. The team meets daily in a daily scrum (standup). A 15-minute meeting.
	3 questions usually asked
		1. what was done (yesterday)
		2. what are you doing (working on today)
		3. any roadblocks?
7. The sprint ends with a sprint review. 
8. After review, the team holds a sprint retrospective. Reflects on process improvements for the next Spring: all of the good and the .
9. Scrum artifacts are always visible and transparent
	- Product backlog
	- sprint backlog
	- increment (the working code)

> Velocity- how much work your team can do

Kanban method - very common in IT support organization through a ticket system
- Has 3 columns
	- Requested
	- Progress
	- Done

### Agile meetings
- In the agile process there are five defined meetings
	1. Product backlog refining 
	2. Sprint planning
	3. Daily scrum
	4. Sprint review
