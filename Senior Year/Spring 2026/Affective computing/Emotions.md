### What is emotion (components)
- Cognitive - influenced by thinking
- Physiological - heart rate, blood pressure, respiration
- Expressive - facial expression
- Motivation - goal
	- Context!
- Feeling - awareness of being in an emotional state
- Different theories look at different 
	- appraisal - assessing something or someone
	- misappraisal - lack of valuation
Emotional phase
- Low-level : auto reflex
- High-level : deliberate decision making
- Behavior prep
- behavior execution
- Communication 

Valence - roughly how happy or sad you are
This is a look at dimensional emotion

This is a more accurate 3 dimensional model of potential emotions

Theories of emotion
1. Physiological - physical effects
	- James Lange theory of emotion - emotions are the result of interpreting our body's physiological responses to external stimuli

2. Neurological - brain biology
	- Cannon Bard - when you encounter an emotional stimulus, your brain simultaneously triggers both the subjective feeling of the emotion (like fear) and the physical arousal (like a racing heart) independently, rather than one causing the other.

3. Cognitive - what are you thinking
	- Schachter Singer - proposes that an emotion arises from two key components: physiological arousal (like a racing heart or sweating) and a cognitive label (interpreting the situation and physical response)

4. Appraisal theory (Lazarus)

	- Due to the potential problem present due to the environment you illicit an emotion and then make a decision. A decision to act upon the environment or to act 
Facial Feedback theory of emotion (Darwin and James)
- There is a direct link between actions and emotions
- i.e (at a high level)
	- Smiling will make you happy 
- Strong vs Weak
	- Strong: Expression causes emotion
	- Weak: Expression modulates emotion
Constructive Theory 
- Emotions are NOT biologically hardwired and NOT universal
- They are constructed by:
	- Affect (arousal and valence)
	- Context (beliefs, culture, experience, etc.)
- Emotions are learned, culturally viable, and context dependent
Dual-process Theory of emotion
- BOTH your emotions and your cognition effect your behavior. 
	- i.e you want some chocolate but need to lose weight
		- In the event you eat the chocolate you are emotionally happy however, you do not follow your diet 
		- In the event you do not eat the chocolate you can emotionally sad, however you stick to your diet
	- Analytically decisions are slower when emotionally decisions are much quicker
