Stacks follow a LILO (last in last out) approach to storing data. Think of a stack of plates. Adding a data element will make it the last element but since it is on top it is also the first to go.

Stacks documentation (Linked lists)
- To add to the tail/top of stack: push()
- To delete the tail/top in the stack: pop()
- To get the tail/top of the stack(return it): peek()
Stacks documentation (Arrays)
Note: It is very similar to vectors...
- To add/expand on stack: push()
- To decrease size or remove from the stack: pop()
- To return the top or last element in the stack: peek()
