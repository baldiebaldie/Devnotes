TOPICS ON MIDTERM 3 
1. binary tree (1q coding question)
	- [Trees](Trees.md)
	- Binary tree worksheet (q1, q2, q3):  old midterm 2 (q6): old midterm 3 (q6): Slides 
2. AVL tree (1q NON-coding question)
	- [AVL trees](AVL%20trees.md)
	- Expect questions asking to rebalance and unbalance BST: Draw the resultant tree: Old midterm 3 (q4) NOTE there is no code all you have to do is draw the resulting BST 
3. Heaps (2q: 1 coding question, 1 NON-coding question) 
	- [Heaps](Heaps.md)
	- Heaps worksheet (q1, q2, q3): old midterm 2 (q1(heapify the tree questions))
4. Binary Search (1q coding question)
	-  [Binary serach](Binary%20serach.md)
	- Binary search worksheet (q1, q2) : old Midterm 2 (q4)
5. Hash Map (1q NON-coding question)
	- [Maps and hashes](Maps%20and%20hashes.md)
	- [VisualAlgo Seperate chaining and quadratic probing ](https://visualgo.net/en/hashtable?slide=1)
	- Slides collision handling questions: Quadtratic probing questions: (NOTE for these questions there is no coding, you must draw the hash table)
6. Binary search tree (1q coding question)
	- [Binary Search Tree andAVL Trees](Binary%20Search%20Tree%20andAVL%20Trees.md)
	- binary search tree worksheet (q1, q2): old midterm 3 (q5)
	- NO BFS OR DFS

Past midterm 2 and 3 from last semester are posted on canvas
Exam will have 4 coding questions and 3 NON-coding questions
