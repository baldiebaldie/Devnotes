\#heading 1 is how you make a heading
You can have different indentations of headings (subheadings) if you use multiple ##

For italics you use * word * or you can use _ word _
like this *word* _word_.

For bold you use \*\*word** or you can use \_\_word__ 
like this **word** or __word__

For strikethrough you can use \~~word~~ 
like this ~~word~~

For block quote you use the \> operator at the beginning of a line

>Example of a comment or quote

For a link the text we want to go into the link is in brackets and the actual link itself into parantheses
 [Example link](https://github.com/baldiebaldie)

 For an image it is the same syntax as a link just with a !. Like this

 \!\[hover name](image.png)

 You can also reference image files from other folders by first specifying the path from the folder with the current markdown file to the folder with the desired image. 

 i.e like this
